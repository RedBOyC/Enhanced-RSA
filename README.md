Before running the semiprime.py, set the time period for how long the code should generate prime numbers for. The default is 10s.
Run the semiprime.py, it would generate the semiprime.txt file. (Recommended to use t=10s so that the txt file won't be too large)
Before running the dataset.py, adjust the functions to ones you prefer, and the range of data and number of data you need.
Run dataset.py to generate the dataset.csv file that would be needed by the model.
If you have changed the functions/added extra ones, adjust the model.py accordingly.
